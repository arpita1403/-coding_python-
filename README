Binary Tree Traversal in Python

This is a simple Python program that shows how a binary tree works.
It creates a small binary tree and prints its inorder, preorder,
and postorder traversals.

The tree used in this program looks like this:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

When you run the program, you will see:
- Inorder traversal
- Preorder traversal
- Postorder traversal
